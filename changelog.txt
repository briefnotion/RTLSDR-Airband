V 0.03A_220521
  - Split and renamed a few libraries.  I will try to make the api.h as
      as portable as possible because the same api base will be needed 
      in RasFLED.  
  - I still think my time could be better spent building a prostetic arm,  
      but, I was given a radio, not motors and relays.

V 0.01A_220519
  - Brought in my rasapi.h library from RASFled.

      program would behave.
